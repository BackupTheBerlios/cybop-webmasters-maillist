Dear Fellows,

since the berliOS developer portal announced end of 2011
that it would close down, the CYBOP project moved to:

http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/cybop/
http://www.nongnu.org/cybop/

If you are interested, please sign the NEW mailing list:

cybop-developers at nongnu.org
https://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/cybop-developers

Best regards,
Christian
